#### API Design

```
GET /api/status                    # System and connection status
GET /api/config                    # Current configuration
PUT /api/config                    # Update configuration
POST /api/config/validate          # Validate configuration
GET /api/collections               # List collections
POST /api/collections              # Create collection
GET /api/operations                # Operation history
POST /api/operations/start         # Start Kometa run
POST /api/operations/stop          # Stop current operation
GET /api/logs                      # Get filtered logs
```

Note: Configuration can be edited via forms OR YAML editor on separate pages.
Import/export functionality allows moving between formats.

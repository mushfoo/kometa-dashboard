## Risk Mitigation Throughout Development

### Daily Practices

- [ ] Deploy and test every feature immediately after implementation
- [ ] Share progress in Kometa Discord for community feedback
- [ ] Maintain modular architecture with independent components
- [ ] Keep CLI functionality as fallback for all GUI features

### Quality Gates

- [ ] All commits must pass automated test suite
- [ ] Code coverage must remain >90% at all times
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode must pass with zero `any` types
- [ ] Performance benchmarks must meet targets before merge
- [ ] Security scans must pass before each weekly milestone

# Kometa GUI - Detailed Task Breakdown for Junior Developers

## Overview

Each task includes specific deliverables, acceptance criteria, and test requirements to minimize scope creep and ensure precise implementation.

**Note:** This task breakdown implements the MVP architecture as specified in the PRD:

- **No Authentication**: Authentication moved to Phase 2 for MVP simplicity
- **File-based Storage**: Using JSON files for easier deployment and development
- **Next.js API Routes**: Using Next.js built-in API routes for serverless deployment
- **Smart Polling**: Using efficient polling + SSE for real-time updates

## Task Management Protocol

### Completion Rules

1. **One sub-task at a time**: Work through each `[ ]` checkbox sequentially
2. **Immediate completion marking**: Change `[ ]` to `[x]` immediately after finishing each sub-task
3. **Parent task completion**: Only mark parent tasks (like "Task 1.1") as `[x]` when ALL sub-tasks are complete
4. **File tracking**: Add all created/modified files to "Relevant Files" section after each sub-task
5. **Emerging tasks**: Insert new tasks as they're discovered during development

### Development Workflow

- **Before starting work**: Check this file to identify next incomplete sub-task
- **During work**: Focus on single sub-task completion with defined acceptance criteria
- **After each sub-task**: Update this file with progress and file changes
- **After each parent task**: Commit all changes with descriptive commit message
- **Quality gate**: Each task has test criteria that must pass before marking complete

### Git Workflow

- **Foundation Phase (Day 1)**: Work on single `foundations` branch for all setup tasks
- **Feature Development**: Create feature branches for major components after foundations
- **Commit Strategy**: One commit per completed parent task (e.g., after all Task 1.1 sub-tasks done)
- **Commit Messages**: Use format "Complete Task X.X: [Task Description]"

**Expected Day 1 Commit Sequence:**

1. `Initial Next.js setup` (on main branch, then switch to foundations branch)
2. `Complete Task 1.2: Create CLAUDE.md Project Context` (on foundations branch)
3. `Complete Task 1.3: Configure TypeScript Strict Mode` (on foundations branch)
4. `Complete Task 1.4: Docker Development Environment` (on foundations branch)
5. `Complete Task 1.5: Code Quality Tools Setup` (on foundations branch)

**Expected Day 3 Commit Sequence:**

1. `Complete Task 3.1: Next.js API Foundation` (create feature branch from main)
2. `Complete Task 3.2: GitHub Actions CI/CD Setup` (continue on feature branch)
3. `Complete Task 3.3: File Storage System Setup` (continue on feature branch)
4. `Complete Task 3.4: Settings Management System` (continue on feature branch)
